## Whiteboard Process


### Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in the original tree because it takes time to traverse the tree. However, it is linear and will not effect time complexity.

### Solution

<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
